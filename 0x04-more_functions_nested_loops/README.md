 1 # PROJECT 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loop

  4 #### Nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called as â€œloop inside loop"
  5 `(A nested loop is a loop inside the body of another loop)`

  7 - Note: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
  8 ~ You have to start by creating your `main.h` first.
  9 ```
 10 main.h file is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project.

 13 - `File: 0-isupper.c` is a function that checks for uppercase character.
 14 
 15 - `File: 1-isdigit.c` is a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
 16 
 17 - `File: 2-mul.c` is a function that multiplies two integers.
 18 
 19 - `File 3-print_numbers.c` is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
 20 
 21 - `File 4-print_most_numbers.c` is a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
 22 
 23 - `File 5-more_numbers.c` is a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
 24 
 25 - `File 6-print_line.c` is a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
 26 
 27 - `File 7-print_diagonal.c` is a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
 28 
 29 - `File 8-print_square.c` is a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
 30 
 31 - `File 9-fizz_buzz.c` is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line, but for multiples of three prints Fizz instead     of the number and for the multiples of five prints Buzz.
 32 
 33 - `File 10-print_triangle.c` is a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
